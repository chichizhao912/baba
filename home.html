    <h1>Dear Baba,</h1>
    <p class="green"> <strong>Happy Birthday!!!</strong>!</p>
    <p>This is the first birthday since I was born that I have no spent by you and mama's side. Although I really wish that I could be with you and mama today, I want you to know that I know that we are still 
        together in our own way. I will try to not feel sad, inside I will feel happy, because every year on the 3rd of September, I feel extra love and warmth from the universe, and I know that we are closer 
    than ever.</p>
    <p>Baba, I love you so much. I really love calling you everyday, it makes me feel not lonely, and your opinions are the ones I value the most. I really hope that I can talk to you every day, because ever since 
        I was young, I have always loved listening and talking to you about so many different things. 
    </p>
    <p class="blue"> <em> Thank you and mama for always protecting me and caring for me so much. You are the best mama and baba ever! (Of course).</em></p>
    <h2>P.S.</h2>
    <p>I'm sorry that I can't give you a better birthday gift this year, I will make sure to make up for it in all of our birthdays to come. I hope you and mama really enjoy the cake together.</p>
